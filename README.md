# Project Volta : SPI, I2C, SRAM and Bandgap Reference in 0.6um CMOS Technology.
In this project 12 undergraduate students designed, simulated and tested a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for a 32 byte Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) using an 0.6um CMOS Technology which can be used as a low power consuming device by integrating it with Microcontrollers (MCUs) and peripheral ICs ,for example IOT sensors. The project was accomplished using Tanner EDA tools to design, simulate and layout the circuits. This project also contained the other IPs

# Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)
## Abstract
This paper presents the detailed design and implementation of a Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) in CMOS technology. The entire operation of the SRAM (read, write, and control) is done through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), an industry-standard serial protocol, without the requirement of any built-in clock or bias, making it compact and low-power. This SRAM is specifically suitable for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications with slow access rates and low power consumption like IoT-based environment sensors. For the purpose of demonstration, a 32-byte SRAM was designed and fabricated in 0.6um CMOS technology and successfully tested for its full functionality after fabrication.
